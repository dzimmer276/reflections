What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	the hidden file .git is created.  This is used I assume to index the files in the directory so they can be tracked as part of a larger project.   
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	This is the area that allows one to stage files prior to a first commit.  This allows one to keep the repository cleaner at the start of a new project.   
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
	Automatic may overright some commits that should not be included... It is better to manually review the commit prior to making changes...
	This has been a while since I have added an entry.
